# Blackjack Game

This is a custom-built Blackjack game developed from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. While the project idea was inspired by Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Path, the entire design and codebase were independently created to practice building interactive web applications and managing game logic.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I believe in building a strong foundation in programming while also learning how to effectively use AI tools as part of a modern developer workflow.

## ✨ Overview

This project showcases a functional Blackjack game that allows users to play against a virtual dealer. It includes:

- A user interface displaying the player's and dealer's cards
- Buttons to "Hit" or "Stand"
- Real-time game status updates
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The game initializes by dealing two cards each to the player and the dealer.
- The player can choose to "Hit" to receive another card or "Stand" to end their turn.
- The dealer reveals their hidden card and draws additional cards according to standard Blackjack rules.
- The game calculates the total points for both hands and determines the winner.
- The interface updates dynamically to reflect the current game state.

## 🛠️ Personalization

Although the initial concept was provided by Scrimba, the following customizations were implemented:

- Designed and styled the layout from scratch using CSS
- Implemented game logic in JavaScript to handle card dealing, scoring, and game outcomes
- Ensured responsiveness across various screen sizes

## 🚧 Planned Updates

- Add functionality to reset the game without refreshing the page
- Implement betting system with virtual chips
- Enhance the user interface with improved styling and animations

## 🗂️ File Structure (basic)

- `index.html` – Main structure of the webpage
- `index.css` – Styling for layout and design
- `index.js` – JavaScript for handling game logic and user interactions
- `vite.config.js` – Configuration for Vite
